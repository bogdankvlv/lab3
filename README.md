 * The main point of this program is that it tells you the names of
 * the artists that appear on the top 200 list for Spotify and how many times
 * they appear on that list. The way this program works is that it scans in a
 * file in which this case its a csv file and its the top 200 artists for the
 * week on Spotify. While the scanner is scanning in each number and each string
 * there is multiple for loops in my program that keep track of the number of
 * artists, how many times they appear, and how many unique artists there are in
 * the top 200 list.I also used another technique of implementing a if loop to
 * see if the same artist appears more than one time and if they do there is a
 * counter which keeps track of this. I also declared a PrintStream object in
 * order to print to a file all the artists that were found and how many times
 * they reappeared on the top 200 list.
